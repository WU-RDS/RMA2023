<br>
Welcome to the course **Retail Marketing Analytics**! This course covers the conceptual foundations of data analysis techniques for marketing managers and applications of these methods to different data sets. The course will be delivered in parts using the **flipped classroom** teaching method. This means that students are required to familiarize themselves with the contents by means of **self-study** *before* each session (i.e., by going through the assigned materials on their own). This website is intended to aid the self-study process by providing you with explanations regarding the relevant concepts and methods in text and video format along with code files and commented outputs that will show you how to implement these methods using the **statistical software R**. 
<br><br>
The self-learning process will be complemented with compulsory in-person **weekly interactive sessions** in the PC lab, which provide ample opportunities to train the acquired knowledge and clarify points that require further discussion. 
<br><br>
The following pages outline the course schedule and explain how to use this tutorial in detail. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a short email.

# Introduction {-}

## Course structure {-}

This course combines asynchronous teaching elements (e.g., texts and pre-recorded videos on this website) with synchronous elements (e.g., weekly in-person interactive sessions in the PC Lab). The syllabus consists of three main parts, as reflected by the structure of this website: 

1. **Lecture notes**: the lecture part will explain the theory behind the concepts and methods and provide you with example applications using the statistical software R.
2. **Individual assignments**: the individual assignments require you to apply the acquired knowledge to new data sets.
3. **Group project**: in the group you will design and conduct your own market research project and transfer the knowledge to a real business setting.

The general approach is that students will first familiarize themselves with the contents by going through the materials on their own. This **self-study** process is complemented with in-person **weekly interactive sessions** in the PC lab, which provide ample opportunities to ask questions and clarify points that require further discussion. The schedule for each of the three parts will be explained below. 

### Schedule {-}

#### In-person lecture {-}

The contents on this website are divided into weekly readings. To be able to follow the curriculum and complete the assignments, you need to read the materials assigned for the respective week. The relevant chapters are indicated in the table below. The weekly readings will be complemented with weekly interactive sessions in the PC lab, which provide you with an opportunity to ask questions about the assigned readings. **Please note that you need to go through the materials on your own in the week before the respective session.** For example, chapters 2, 3 & 4 will be discussed in the second session. The dates and times for the classroom sessions are indicated in the table below for each group separately. It is highly recommended to prepare questions or comments about the materials for these sessions that you think might be interesting and helpful to the class. As a preparation for the in-class discussions, you should go through the **Learning check** section at the end of each chapter. By working through these questions, you may self-assess your progress and identify knowledge gaps regarding the materials that were assigned for the previous week.

We understand that the self-study format might pose challenges to the learning process because we cannot troubleshoot in person outside of the classroom sessions. Remember that it is very unlikely that you are the only student encountering a particular problem. So please make use of the forum on Learn\@WU (see below) to interact with your peers or ask us questions so that everyone else will benefit from the answer (there are no stupid questions!). In case you cannot get answers to address a specific problem, we will be available during the in-person classroom sessions for coaching.
:::

#### Individual assignments {-}

There will be 3 individual assignments. These assignments need to be submitted in the [R Markdown format](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (see chapter 8) via Learn\@wu. There will be a coaching session dedicated to the R Markdown reporting format in the second session, when the first homework is assigned.

#### Group project {-}

The group project consists of an extended analysis of a data set using the methods we covered in the course and the reporting of the results using the R markdown format.

The **submission date** for the group project is on **June 14, 2023**. There is an opportunity to schedule a **coaching session** regarding the group project on **June 12** between 9:00AM nd 5:00PM. If you would like to make use of the opportunity to schedule a coaching session, please register an appointment by sending me an email.

Again, please make sure that you have exhausted all other resources to solve a particular problem, such as the online tutorial, the forum on Learn\@wu, and other web resources (see below) before you schedule a coaching session. If you feel that other students might have similar questions and would benefit from an answer to a particular question, you should post the question in the forum on Learn\@wu.
<br>

### Grading {-}

Grading is based on the following components:

* **Market research group project** (data analysis & reporting) [weight: 30%]
* **Individual take-home computer exercises** (statistical analysis of data sets; 3 assignments accounting for 10% each [weight: 30%]
* **Final online exam** (concepts & methods) [weight: 30%]
* **Class participation** (quantity & quality of contributions during the weekly sessions, contributions in the online forum, etc.) [weight: 10%]

These grading components will be weighted with the respective weights to arrive at the final grade percentage.

The **final exam** will take place online on **June 01, 2023 from 4:00PM - 06:00PM**. Details about the setup of the exam will be provided in the course. The exam covers questions about the concepts and methods (no coding) and I will provide example exams from the previous years to give you an idea about what type of questions you can expect.   

To ensure an equal contribution of group members for the group assignment, a **peer assessment** will be conducted among group members, which enters into the computation of the individual grades for the project. This means that the members of a group are required to assess other students regarding their relative contribution. 

**To successfully pass this course, your weighted final grade needs to exceed 60%.**

## Course materials {-}

### Main reference {-}

The main reference for this course is this website along with the corresponding slides and the pre-recorded video lectures. The relevant materials for each week are indicated in the tables above. The aim of the materials is to condense the contents and direct your attention to the most relevant aspects. This should enable students to study the materials on their own and we can focus our attention during the classroom sessions on clarifying points that require further discussion. 

At the end of each chapter, you will find a section with references. It is highly recommended that you consult these references for further clarification in case you require additional information on a topic.
